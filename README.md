# Battleship

#### Battleship game state technical test 

### The task
The task is to implement a Battleship state-tracker for a single player that must support the following logic:
* Create a board
* Add a battleship to the board
* Take an “attack” at a given position, and report back whether the attack resulted in a
hit or a miss
* Return whether the player has lost the game yet (i.e. all battleships are sunk)
The application should not implement the entire game, just the state tracker. No UI or persistence layer is required.
